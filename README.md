# AstronomyImage_processing
Semi-Automatic Astronomical image processing code using Python and Pyraf


This is an semi-automatic code developed using python and pyraf to process raw astronomical images. This is by no means the final version of the code.
I will be updating it from time to time to making it more user friendly and less human intervention dependent. This version is developed for users who is familiar with iraf and pyraf. 


To run this code you need to have Python 2.7 and Pyraf installed in your system.
